Description: Documentation tool for FreeBASIC source code
 Welcome to the fb-doc package. It's a cross-platform multifunctional
 tool, mainly for generating documentation from and for FreeBASIC (= FB)
 source code, but useful for other pruposes as well, ie. like generating
 header files. Rather than creating the documentation output directly,
 fb-doc is designed to close the gap between FB and C syntax to allow for
 using any C / C++ documentation tool-chain. Also it supports the
 creation of documentational comments in the source and it can get
 extended via external plugins.
